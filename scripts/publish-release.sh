#!/usr/bin/env bash
# publish-release.sh — manual-sync a release from the private dev repo
# (CreativeMayhemLtd/provcheck-dev) to the public release repo
# (CreativeMayhemLtd/provcheck), then cut a GitHub Release there.
#
# Usage:
#     scripts/publish-release.sh v0.1.0 "path/to/provcheck-win.zip" "path/to/provcheck-macos.tar.gz" ...
#
# What it does:
#   1. Sanity-checks that the tag exists locally and points at a
#      commit on main.
#   2. Pushes main + the tag to the `public` git remote.
#   3. Generates release notes from the commit log since the prior tag.
#   4. Calls `gh release create` on the public repo, attaching any
#      binary artefacts you pass on the command line.
#
# Requirements:
#   * `git remote show public` must exist and point at
#     https://github.com/CreativeMayhemLtd/provcheck
#     (run `git remote add public https://…` once if missing).
#   * `gh` CLI authed to github.com with `repo` scope.
#
# Deliberately simple — this is the manual-control release flow.
# CI automation arrives in Milestone 4; until then a human (you)
# reviews every public push. That's a feature, not a bug.
